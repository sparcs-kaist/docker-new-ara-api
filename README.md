# Deprecated
Docker related files are managed together in [new-ara-api](https://github.com/sparcs-kaist/new-ara-api) repository.

~~# docker-new-ara-api~~

~~Automatic deployment of new-ara-api~~

~~## Notice~~

~~This repository does not `migrate`, `collectstatic`, or `createsuperuser` - you must do these outside containers created by this docker-compose. This is for auto-generated containers by auto-scaling, not for initial setup or development.~~

~~## Goal~~

~~* setup everything immediately after `docker-compose up`~~
